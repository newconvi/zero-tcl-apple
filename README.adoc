= 🤝🔐 Experimental Zero Trust Client for iOS

This implementation is based on https://dsr.gematik.solutions/[DSR PoC]. The iOS code has been rewritten with following goals in mind:

* Minimum dependencies
* CryptoKit support
* Support for both MTLS and JOSE based client identities
* Multi-client support

.Usage example
[source,swift]
----
client = try TrustClient(regURL: URL(string: "https://zerobin.spilikin.dev")!)
let certificate = try await client.updateMTLSCertificate()
let urlSession = try client.makeMTLSURLSession()
let response = try await urlSession.data(from: URL(string: "https://zerobin.spilikin.dev/echo")!)
